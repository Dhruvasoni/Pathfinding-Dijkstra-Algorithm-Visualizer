Welcome to the Pathfinder-Visualizer repository! Here, you'll find a powerful and visually engaging implementation of the famous Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding. This project aims to provide an intuitive way to understand and explore the workings of Dijkstra's algorithm, a popular method for finding the shortest path in a graph.

With the Pathfinder-Visualizer, users can interactively visualize the step-by-step execution of Dijkstra's algorithm, allowing for a better understanding of how it efficiently computes the shortest paths. The visualization provides a clear representation of the graph, highlighting the visited nodes, the current shortest paths, and the overall progress of the algorithm.

Key Features:

Interactive Visualization: Gain a visual understanding of Dijkstra's algorithm by observing the exploration process, highlighting the visited nodes, and tracking the shortest paths.

Custom Graph Creation: Create custom graphs by defining nodes, edges, and their respective weights, enabling experimentation with different scenarios and graph structures.

Start and Target Node Selection: Choose any node as the starting point and a target node, making it easy to find the shortest path between any two points in the graph.

Step-by-Step Execution: Observe each step of Dijkstra's algorithm, from initial node selection to final path calculation, enhancing comprehension of the algorithm's logic and behavior.

Performance Metrics: Gain insights into the algorithm's performance, such as the total number of nodes visited and the distance to each node from the source.

Contributions:
Contributions to the Pathfinder-Visualizer project are highly encouraged! Whether you want to add new features, improve existing ones, or fix any bugs, your contributions will help make this project even more valuable to the pathfinding community. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide feedback in the discussions section.

We hope that the Pathfinder-Visualizer serves as an educational resource and a useful tool for understanding Dijkstra's algorithm. Join us in exploring the fascinating world of graph theory and pathfinding!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
